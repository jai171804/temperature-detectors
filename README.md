# temperature-detectors
temperature detection system where a user enters a temperature value, and the system analyzes it using fuzzy logic to classify the temperature into categories like Cold, Warm, and Hot. Unlike traditional logic, fuzzy logic allows smooth transitions between categories, making it useful for real-world applications where temperature values vary continuously.

Key Components of the Project
User Input:

The user will enter a temperature value manually.
The system will process the input and determine its category using fuzzy logic.
Fuzzy Logic Concept:

Instead of crisp conditions (e.g., "If temperature > 30, it's hot"), fuzzy logic uses degrees of membership.
Example: A temperature of 28°C can be 60% Warm and 40% Hot instead of being strictly classified as one or the other.
Fuzzy Sets & Membership Functions:

You need to define fuzzy sets (e.g., Cold, Warm, Hot).
Membership functions determine how much a value belongs to a set.
Example membership function:
Cold: 0°C to 15°C
Warm: 10°C to 30°C
Hot: 25°C to 50°C
Fuzzy Rules:

Rules are used to determine the output based on fuzzy inputs.
Example fuzzy rules:
If Temperature is Cold, then "Wear a Jacket."
If Temperature is Warm, then "Normal Clothing is fine."
If Temperature is Hot, then "Use an Air Conditioner."
Defuzzification:

Converts fuzzy results back into a crisp value or category for easy interpretation.
Example: If a temperature is 28°C and is 60% Warm and 40% Hot, the system may classify it as "Mostly Warm."
